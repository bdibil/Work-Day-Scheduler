# Work Day Scheduler 
  
## This Work Day Scheduler uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
  
-	It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and jQuery
-	Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green)
-	When the save button for that timeblock is clicked, the text for that event is NOT saved in local storage (Work in progress)
