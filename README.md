# Work Day Scheduler 
  
## This Work Day Scheduler uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
  
-	It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## EDIT BELOW

-	A timer starts and the questions begin as soon as the user clicks the start button 
-	Questions will continue to appear if there is time left and the user answers correctly 
-	If an incorrect answer is selected, the timer will decrease 
-	The game is over when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
-	Afterwards, the user can enter their initials and their score is stored in Local Storage
